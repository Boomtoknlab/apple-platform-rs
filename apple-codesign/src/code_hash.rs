/*! Functionality related to hashing code.

One aspect of Apple code signing is binary integrity verification.

The Mach-O signature data contains cryptographic hashes of content
of the thing being signed. The way this works is different sections
of the binary are split into chunks or pages (e.g. of 4096 bytes).
The cryptographic hash of each chunk is computed and the hashes
are written to the signature data. When the binary is loaded, as a
hash is paged into the kernel, its cryptographic hash is verified against
what is inside the binary.

This module contains code related to reading and writing these so-called
*code hashes*.
